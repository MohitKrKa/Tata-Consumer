            <div className='mb-2'>
            Our objective is to achieve water
neutrality in every location we operate
by the year 2030, recognising the vital
importance of water efficiency and
conservation as core components of
our strategic approach. Water is not
only a key ingredient in our products
but also a critical resource in our
manufacturing processes. Given the
pressing issue of water scarcity in
various regions globally, the evaluation
and management of water risks are
imperative to maintain the sustainability
and robustness of our business.
In FY 2023-24, we embarked on a
comprehensive water risk assessment,
aimed at uncovering avenues to
advance water efficiency throughout
our production operations.
In line with our commitment to
transparency in water management
practices, we adhere to the Climate
Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB)
Framework for reporting waterrelated information and evaluating
water risks. This commitment is part
of our broader strategy to embrace a
long-term outlook that safeguards the
sustainability of our water resources.
To fortify our resilience against waterrelated risks, we have carried out
water risk assessments at enterprise
level for all our business segments. For
these assessments, we have utilised
reputed third-party tools such as the
WRI Aqueduct and the WWF Water
Risk Filter, ensuring that our strategies
are informed by the best available
data and methodologies.
Dedicated to the judicious use of
water, we are on a continuous quest
to decrease our water usage ratio. We
understand that water conservation is
not just an environmental imperative
but also a pathway to cost-efficiency
and sustainable growth. Our strategy
is centred around process optimisation,
water recycling and the adoption of
the 3R principle: Reduce, Reuse and
Recycle.
To minimise water loss, we have
refined the Piping and Instrumentation
Diagram (P&ID) for our filler rinsing
and filling operations, effectively
reducing waste caused by pressure
variations and interruptions. We
have optimised water recycling by
capturing, filtering and re-routing the
water from these processes for use in
utilities, achieving notable savings in
freshwater consumption.
All wastewater generated in our
processes are directed to our state-ofthe-art Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP),
where it is treated and repurposed
for ancillary uses such as gardening
and irrigation, allowing us to progress
towards our goal of zero discharge of
treated water. This has resulted in a
daily conservation of water, marking
a commendable leap forward in
our journey towards environmental
sustainability.
