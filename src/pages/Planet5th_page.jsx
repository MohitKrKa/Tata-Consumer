            <div className='mb-2'>While our Environment Policy serves as
a compass, guiding our eco-conscious
actions, our <a className='text-[#1368b4]' href="">Energy Conservation
Policy</a> establishes the framework
for managing energy across all our
activities. At TCP, we hold a steadfast
commitment to managing our energy
use and emissions with the utmost
responsibility.
Our direct emissions originate from
various fuel sources, including biomass,
diesel, petrol, furnace oil, coal, LPG,
kerosene and refrigerants utilised in our
operational processes. Concurrently, our
indirect energy needs are met through
grid electricity, while we harness solar
power for off-grid configurations,
thereby greening our energy portfolio.
We met 45% of our direct energy needs
through bio-based fuels like firewood,
biomass pellets, spent tea waste,briquettes and husk in FY 2024-25.
This achievement underscores our
dedication to adopting energy solutions
that are not only efficient but also kind
to the environment. This year, XX% of
our power demand was met through
renewable sources, including wind and
solar energy.In our quest to enhance operational
efficiency, we have embraced a suite
of initiatives across our facilities. These
include the deployment of advanced
multitrack packing machines, the
transition to energy-saving LED
lighting and the upgrading of motors,
among other improvements.
We have taken measures to increase
awareness of our Environmental
Management Policy and its impacts
among both internal and external stakeholders. Notably, more than
40% of our manufacturing units
(excluding plantations and offices)
have implemented an Environmental
Management System (EMS) verified
through ISO 14001. We offer
extensive training to all operational
personnel to increase their awareness
of the environmental impact of
their roles. This training covers key
areas such as energy, water and
waste management, including food
waste. We conduct audit of the
environmental parameters like energy,
waste and water to recognise the
areas for improvement. Furthermore,
we are actively pursuing ISO
50001 certification to reinforce our
commitment to energy efficiency.</div>
