AND BIODIVERSITY</div>
<div className='mb-2'>At TCP, we are dedicated to preserving
biodiversity, with a special focus on
regions of ecological significance
such as hotspots and forested areas
near our subsidiaries and associate
companies’ plantations in Coorg,
Munnar, and Assam. The Company’s
conservation strategies are designed
to shield these forest regions from
human encroachment. We employ
nature-focused initiatives that include
ecosystem restoration, the protection
of natural habitats and tackling
challenges unique to each ecosystem.
With a legacy of environmental
stewardship, our plantations are
models of sustainability, recognised
with global certifications.</div>

We observed a remarkable uptick
in our bio-indicators, notably bees,
which has led to enhanced pollination
and a surge in honey production.
This initiative is part of our broader
commitment to sustainable practices
that extend beyond environmental
conservation to include community
empowerment. By offering training
and capacity-building programmes, we
provided communities with the means
to secure sustainable livelihoods.
Our commitment to balancing
productivity with ecological
mindfulness establishes a standard in
the industry, ensuring that every cup
of coffee or tea we produce stands as
a testament to our ethos of care and
responsibility. The Company’s ongoing
efforts are dedicated to protecting
biodiversity, empowering local
communities and nurturing a lasting
harmony between agricultural success
and the natural environment.
