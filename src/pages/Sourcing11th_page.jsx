Our recent acquisition, Organic India, procures 30
different kinds of crops cultivated over 9000 acres of
land, with Tulsi being the biggest produce purchased.
To support our farming community, we distribute
Tulsi seeds free of cost to farmers. These farmers
are selected based on their crops, ensuring that they
can maintain healthy crops through proper irrigation,
effective weed management and by avoiding mixed
cultivation. This initiative not only promotes sustainable
agricultural practices but also strengthens our
commitment to empowering local farmers. Farmers
are also educated on a host of initiatives such as
crop rotation, which extends beyond the crops we
purchase. These efforts are aimed at promoting the
overall wellbeing of the farming community. The Tulsi
cultivated by farmers is procured by Organic India at
competitive rates, which are at par with, or slightly
above the prevailing market prices for quality produce.
Although the tulsi seeds are distributed by us, farmers
are free to sell their produce either Organic India or in
the open market.

Our comprehensive training module, covers all the key


stakeholders involved in our tea industry's operations-
We have implemented specialised training

programmes for Small Tea Growers (STGs), focusing
on advanced plant protection protocols, integrated
pest management, soil management and traceability
systems. These comprehensive training sessions
are part of our strategic initiative in North Bengal
and Assam to disseminate exemplary agricultural
practices.
Suppliers have the opportunity to utilise resources
like Trustea and Rainforest Alliance (RA) for
valuable guidance and standards in sustainability
best practices. This enables them to learn from the
ESG practices of peers, industry leaders and global
standards.
