            The superior quality of our products and the trust instilled in our
            brands have been pivotal in securing and maintaining our leadership
            status across portfolio categories. All our products are produced
            and packaged in cutting-edge facilities that not only adhere to, but
            also surpass global food safety norms and regulations. We undertake
            ongoing quality enhancement initiatives, beginning with sourcing, to
            uphold quality standard that resonate with and is valued by our
            consumers. TCP’s Quality department meticulously conducts supplier
            audits, both to affirm compliance with our standards and to identify
            areas for enhancement. When audits reveal areas for improvement, TCP
            teams engage suppliers with concrete corrective action plans. This
            includes providing suppliers with detailed information and training
            on TCP’s ESG programme, processes and requirements to ensure they
            understand and meet our expectations. Suppliers also receive
            support, whether remote or on-site, to assist in the implementation
            of these corrective and improvement actions. While suppliers
            currently do not have access to ESG benchmarks against peers,
            resources such as the Trustea and Rainforest Alliance (RA) offer
            valuable guidance and standards for best practices in
            sustainability.

              The Executive Management, comprising senior management
              representatives, regularly oversees the implementation of our
              supplier ESG programme and suppliers’ adherence to established ESG
              principles. Additionally, our purchasing practices are
              systematically assessed to maintain their alignment with the
              Supplier Code of Conduct. This cycle of continual review allows us
              to uphold consistent standards of ethical and sustainable
              behaviour in our interactions with suppliers.

            <p className="">
              To enhance collaborations with our packaging material providers,
              we have instituted a biannual Supplier Relationship Management
              (SRM) programme for all our primary packaging suppliers and
              indirect material suppliers, with the aim of improving cost
              management, strengthening governance, encouraging innovation and
              enhancing the visibility of service and performance. The SRM
              process utilises a scoring system based on various performance
              indicators. This process takes place both on-site and off-site.
              Whenever Opportunities for Improvement (OFIs) are identified, TCP
              suggests action plans for suppliers to enhance scores in the
              subsequent audit cycles. This continuous feedback and improvement
              mechanism is a key part of our supplier relationships.
              <p className="mt-2">
                Each indicator carries a specific weightage covering: cost,
                service, quality and capability, innovation and ethical supply.
                In FY 2024-25, we expanded this SRM initiative to include all
                key primary packaging material suppliers as well as strategic
                suppliers across various packaging segments.Besides our Supplier
                Relationship Management programme, we also conduct
                supplier-related trainings including the ones through Trustea.
                This involves intensive classroom training, on-ground work,
                capacity building, digitisation and alignment with current
                trends for our partners and certification bodies. Furthermore, a
                training initiative for Trustea has been launched, backed by
                financial contributions from TCP. Additionally, internal
                training on the Tata Code of Conduct (TCOC), Anti-bribery and
                Corruption (ABAC) Policy Guidelines and Thresholds’ and
                associated subjects is conducted using an interactive,
                scenario-based module that includes comprehensive presentations
                and evaluations.

            Our comprehensive training module, covers all the key
stakeholders involved in our tea industry’s operationsWe have implemented specialised training
programmes for Small Tea Growers (STGs), focusing
on advanced plant protection protocols, integrated
pest management, soil management and traceability
systems. These comprehensive training sessions
are part of our strategic initiative in North Bengal
and Assam to disseminate exemplary agricultural
practices.
Suppliers have the opportunity to utilise resources
like Trustea and Rainforest Alliance (RA) for
valuable guidance and standards in sustainability
best practices. This enables them to learn from the
ESG practices of peers, industry leaders and global
standards.

        Our recent acquisition, Organic India, procures 30
different kinds of crops cultivated over 9000 acres of
land, with Tulsi being the biggest produce purchased.
To support our farming community, we distribute
Tulsi seeds free of cost to farmers. These farmers
are selected based on their crops, ensuring that they
can maintain healthy crops through proper irrigation,
effective weed management and by avoiding mixed
cultivation. This initiative not only promotes sustainable
agricultural practices but also strengthens our
commitment to empowering local farmers. Farmers
are also educated on a host of initiatives such as
crop rotation, which extends beyond the crops we
purchase. These efforts are aimed at promoting the
overall wellbeing of the farming community. The Tulsi
cultivated by farmers is procured by Organic India at
competitive rates, which are at par with, or slightly
above the prevailing market prices for quality produce.
Although the tulsi seeds are distributed by us, farmers
are free to sell their produce either to Organic India or
in the open market.
