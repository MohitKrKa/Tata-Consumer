SUSTAINABILITY RISK
ASSESSMENT</div>
As a part of For Better Sourcing,
TCP developed a framework
providing a structured approach
to identifying, assessing and
mitigating risks that could impact
the sustainability of the supply
chain. The objective of the
framework has been to include
Environmental (E), Social (S) and
Governance (G) considerations
into traditional supply chain risk
management.
Common ESG risks, based on
industry standards such as
ISO 26000, ISO 20400 and
ILO guidelines were taken into
consideration. Additionally,
</div>
<div className='md:pt-24 inline'>
industry specific risks were identified
using other standards such as Farm
Standard, Rainforest Alliance, C.A.F.E.
Practices and OECD guidelines
were also considered. TATA Supplier
Code of Conduct was also used as a
reference.
Procurement leaders for both
commodity and non-commodity
categories were included in the
assessment. The risk study included
all subsidiaries and global operations
to provide a comprehensive overview.
All identified risks were broadly
categorised under the Environmental
(E), Social (S) and Governance (G)
pillars.
The risk register is updated at periodic
intervals and mitigation measures
planned for the key risks identified.
