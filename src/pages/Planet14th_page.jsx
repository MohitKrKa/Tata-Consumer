    Location Screening
</div>
<div className=''>
    <div className='mb-2'>
    Our location screening employed
multiple geospatial data layers to
evaluate 162 TCP facilities across
countries of operation. The assessment
examined environmental sensitivity
through four key parameters: proximity
to protected areas, ecosystem
integrity, biodiversity hotspot presence,
and water stress. This approach
allowed us to identify facilities with
elevated nature-related risks requiring
strategic management attention.
</div>
<div className='flex flex-col justify-center gap-2 mb-2'>
<p>
    <span className=' font-semibold'>
Plantation estates
</span> demonstrated
the highest environmental sensitivity
because of their proximity to ecological
significant areas.
</p>
<p>
<span className=' font-semibold'>Manufacturing facilities, packaging
and storage centres</span> generally show
lower environmental sensitivity
regarding biodiversity parameters with
most falling in areas of low ecosystem
integrity.
</p>
<p>
<span className='text-black font-bold'>Offices and support facilities</span>
    predominantly demonstrate low
environmental sensitivity across
biodiversity and ecosystem parameters.
</p>
</div>
Through this assessment, we
identified 3 priority sites representing
plantations, manufacturing operations
and supply chain — Valparai Estate,
Instant Tea Division, Munnar and
Organic India (Lucknow cluster) —
have been selected for more detailed
site-specific assessments.
The following sections provide an
overview of the assessments at the
corporate level and site level aligning
with TNFD’s recommendations.

Dependencies represent how our business activities rely on ecosystem services and natural assets for operational success.
Higher ratings indicate greater business dependency on that ecosystem service.

Note on categories: Dependencies have been consolidated from detailed ecosystem services in the ENCORE outputs into
four main categories. Impacts have been organised according to the five drivers of nature change as identified by TNFD.
Ratings represent the highest relevant score for each business vertical and category based on findings from ENCORE and
understanding of business and nature interactions.

Note on categories: The risk categories presented in these tables were consolidated from the detailed WWF Biodiversity
Risk Filter indicators while maintaining alignment with the material risks facing TCP. Risk levels were determined based
on the highest relevant indicator score from the WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter for each business vertical and risk category.
Transition risks have been assessed primarily at the sectoral level, where policy changes, technological developments, and
market shifts can impact entire industries. TCP actively monitors these risks and adopts a suite of actions (from rigorous
certifications, partnerships with local implementation agencies, stakeholder consultations, etc.) to mitigate their implications
on business operations.

Opportunities represent strategic advantages TCP can develop by addressing nature-related risks, enhancing dependencies,
and creating positive impacts through sustainable business practices
