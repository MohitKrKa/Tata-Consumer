    <div className='mb-2'>At TCP, we are dedicated to the responsible use of
resources and minimisingw waste in our manufacturing
processes, with a firm commitment to safe and scientific
waste disposal methods. We have set ourselves a
target of achieving zero waste to landfill across all our
operations by FY 2025-26, a goal our global beverage
factories have already proudly accomplished.
We tackle food waste with dedicated programmes
focused on food loss and waste, ensuring that products
occasionally falling short of our high-quality standards
are repurposed, (e.g., converting them into animal feed)
thereby contributing to our waste reduction efforts.
Additionally, products that have reached their expiration
date are gathered and also repurposed into animal feed.
This approach significantly contributes to our waste
reduction efforts. This repurposed food waste product
is either delivered to nearby pig farms or picked up by
municipal authorities. We have established a system to
retrieve expired food items from our network of suppliers
and distributors, both general and modern, throughout
India via a waste processing organisation. This year we
have verified our food loss data through an independent
third party to ensure accuracy and transparency.</div>
