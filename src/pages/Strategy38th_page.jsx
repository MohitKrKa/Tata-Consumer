          The B2B Solubles business offers a full range of instant coffees – from freeze-dried, agglomerated, spray dried and liquid
          extract - to a wide variety of cold water and hot water soluble teas. It was integrated with Tata Consumer Products in
          FY24 after the merger of the erstwhile Tata Coffee Ltd. In FY 25, the Solubles business continued to strengthen its position,
          delivering a robust performance.
