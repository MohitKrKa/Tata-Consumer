      <div className='mb-3'>Our efforts to preserve natural resources and promote biodiversity play a key role in encouraging sustainable
agricultural practices. This delivers higher yields to the growers/ farmers and better-quality raw materials to us.
Through our partnerships with organisations like Trustea and Rainforest Alliance, we promote soil health, ensure that
our growers minimise the use of chemicals in their agricultural practices and respect the interplay between people
and the natural environment in their surroundings.</div>

EQUITY (C.A.F.E.)
PRACTICES </div>
  <div>Our ethical sourcing
approach is anchored by
Coffee and Farmer Equity
(C.A.F.E.) Practices, the
coffee industry’s first set of
ethical sourcing standards.
This certification was
developed by Starbucks,
in collaboration with
Conservation International
in 2004. This programme
measures farms against
economic, social and
environmental criteria to
promote sustainable coffee
cultivation and protect
the well-being of farmers
and their communities,
ensuring a long-term supply
of high-quality coffee.
Starbucks along with SCS
Global Services have spent
over two years revising
the C.A.F.E. Practices
programme.</div>
