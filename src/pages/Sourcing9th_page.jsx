            The superior quality of our products
and the trust instilled in our brands
have been pivotal in securing and
maintaining our leadership status
across portfolio categories. All our
products are produced and packaged
in cutting-edge facilities that not only
adhere to but also surpass global
food safety norms and regulations.
We undertake ongoing quality
enhancement initiatives, beginning
with sourcing, to uphold quality
standard that resonate with and is
valued by our consumers.
TCP's Quality department meticulously
conducts supplier audits, both to affirm
compliance with our standards and
to identify areas for enhancement.
When audits reveal areas for
improvement, TCP teams engage
suppliers with concrete corrective
action plans. This includes providing
suppliers with detailed information
and training on TCP's ESG programme,
processes and requirements to
ensure they understand and meet our
expectations. Suppliers also receive
support , whether remote or on-site, to
assist in the implementation of these
corrective and improvement actions.
While suppliers currently do not have
access to ESG benchmarks against
peers, resources such as the Trustea
and Rainforest Alliance (RA) offer
valuable guidance and standards for
best practices in sustainability.
