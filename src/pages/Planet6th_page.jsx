are on a determined path to achieve carbon neutrality for our direct emissions and the energy we purchase (Scope 1 and Scope
2 emissions) across all regions by FY 2025-26, marking a significant stride towards a more sustainable future. We aim to reach
Net Zero emissions by the year 2040 and we are actively reducing our carbon footprint across our value chain (i.e., including
scope 3 emissions).

reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
