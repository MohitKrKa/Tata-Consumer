  <div >
  Launched as a first-of-its-kind
product, this innovation provides a
convenient solution for consumers
looking to integrate millets into their
daily dietary habits. Traditional millet
flour is often difficult to bind, making
it challenging to prepare rotis with the
right texture. Tata Sampann’s Easy
Cook Ragi Atta simplifies the process,
allowing consumers to prepare soft,
crack-free rotis effortlessly. The atta is
made from 100% ragi flour, free from
maida or any additives, and is rich in
fibre, calcium, and iron. The unique
formulation eliminates the need for
hot water while kneading, reducing
preparation time and effort.
