        <div >
          Launched as a first-of-its-kind
          product, this innovation provides a
          convenient solution for consumers
          looking to integrate millets into their
          daily dietary habits. Traditional millet
          flour is often difficult to bind, making
          it challenging to prepare rotis with the
          right texture. Tata Sampann’s Easy
          Cook Ragi Atta simplifies the process,
          allowing consumers to prepare soft,
          crack-free rotis effortlessly. The atta is
          made from 100% ragi flour, free from
          maida or any additives, and is rich in
          fibre, calcium, and iron. The unique
          formulation eliminates the need for
          hot water while kneading, reducing
          preparation time and effort.
