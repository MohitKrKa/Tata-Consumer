          EXPANDING THE
          COFFEE FOOTPRINT
        </div>
        <div className=''>
          Tata Coffee rapidly expanded its
          footprint across geographies, fueled by
          newer formats and flavours, crossing
          the INR 100 Crores in Gross Revenue
          milestone in FY 2024-25.
          Tata Coffee has progressively
          diversified its product portfolio to cater
          to multiple consumption occasions
          and regional preferences. While its
          mass instant coffee offering - Tata
          Coffee Grand continued to strengthen
          its standing across channels, it
          accelerated the premium freeze-dried
          offering - Tata Coffee Gold, launching
          exciting new flavours of Hazelnut
          and Vanilla to tap into the growing
          premium coffee segment.
          Innovative and convenient format
          launches, like Filter Coffee Decoction,
          offering unique blends in three regionspecific flavours, helped cater to the
          evolving consumer preferences.
