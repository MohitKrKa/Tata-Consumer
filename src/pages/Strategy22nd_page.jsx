          AND SCALABLE READY-TO-DRINK BUSINESS</div>

        <div className='mb-3'>The Ready-To-Drink (RTD) business
          has established a strong foundation
          for long-term sustainable and
          profitable growth, enabled by a
          fundamentally strong business model,
          differentiated products and a strong
          innovation pipeline.</div>

          STRENGTHENING
          HYDRATION PLAY
        </div>
        <div className='mb-3'>
          Tata Copper+ continues to strengthen
          its play in the hydration segment,
          gaining traction through its unique
          positioning. The brand taps into the
          long-standing Indian tradition of storing
          water in copper vessels, resonating
          with consumers seeking functional
          benefits in everyday hydration. During
          this fiscal, the brand continued its
          strong growth trajectory, growing 18%,
          delivering an annualised growth of 72%
          over the last 5 years. Strengthening
          its institutional partnerships, Tata
          Copper+ became the hydration partner
          of choice for the Air India Group, further
          enhancing its visibility.
          The premium portfolio, led by
          Himalayan, has also demonstrated
          robust growth, contributing 11% of
          the RTD business in FY25, up from
          10% in FY24. A dedicated frontline
          sales team has improved targeting
          and deepened relationships within
          the HoReCa segment, reinforcing
          the brand’s premium positioning.
          With a widening consumer base, the
          business is well-placed to explore
          further opportunities within India’s
          hydration market.
