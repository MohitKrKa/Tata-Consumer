                The Executive Management,
comprising senior management
representatives regularly oversees
the implementation of our supplier
ESG programme and suppliers’
adherence to established ESG
principles. Additionally, our purchasing
practices are systematically assessed
to maintain their alignment with
the Supplier Code of Conduct. This
cycle of continual review allows us to
uphold consistent standards of ethical
and sustainable behaviour in our
interactions with suppliers.
To enhance collaborations with our
packaging material providers, we
have instituted a biannual Supplier
Relationship Management (SRM)
programme for all our primary
packaging suppliers and indirect
material suppliers, with the aim
of improving cost management,
strengthening governance,
encouraging innovation and enhancing the visibility of service
and performance. The SRM process
utilises a scoring system based on
various performance indicators. This
process takes place both on-site and
off-site. Whenever Opportunities for
Improvement (OFIs) are identified, TCP
suggests action plans for suppliers
to enhance scores in the subsequent
audit cycles. This continuous feedback
and improvement mechanism is a key
part of our supplier relationships.
Each indicator carries a specific
weightage: covering cost, service,
quality and capability, innovation and
ethical supply. In FY 2024-25, we
expanded this SRM initiative to include
all key primary packaging material
suppliers as well as strategic suppliers
across various packaging segments.Besides our Supplier Relationship
Management programme, we also
conduct supplier-related trainings
including the ones through Trustea.

For our international operations,
empower our tea buying, blending and
supply chain management staff with
knowledge and skills to identify and
combat slavery and human trafficking.
Our focused training programme
includes:

This involves intensive classroom
training, on-groundwork, capacity
building, digitisation and alignment
with current trends for our partners
and certification bodies. Furthermore,
a training initiative for Trustea has
been launched, backed by financial
contributions from TCP. Additionally,
internal training on the Tata Code
of Conduct (TCOC), Anti-bribery
and Corruption (ABAC) Policy
Guidelines and Thresholds’ and
associated subjects is conducted
using an interactive, scenario-based
module that includes comprehensive
presentations and evaluations.
