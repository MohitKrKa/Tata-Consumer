              At TCP, our dedication to sustainable
              sourcing extends to all our product
              offerings, including our tea, coffee,
              water and food staples such as pulses.
              We aspire to base our sourcing on
              the principles of sustainability and
              strive to ensure that our supply chain
              consistently reflects this value. As
              founding member of institutions like
              the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP) in UK
              and Trustea in India, we are committed
              to creating a vibrant tea industry that
              upholds principles of sustainability. This
              involves striving for sustainable growth
              throughout the entire tea supply chain -
              from cultivation to consumption.
              Our #ForBetter Sourcing strategy
              involves a three-step process – Define,
              Identify and Engage. It is guided
              by a two-pronged approach - the
              source materials not only need to
              be sustainable but should also be
              responsibly produced. This approach
              ensures that the resources we use leave
              a minimal environmental footprint and
              are ethically sourced, adhering to fair
              labour and manufacturing practices.
              This focus ensures the environmental
              footprint is minimised during production
              and the materials used are in line with
              our long-term sustainability goals.

            Our dedication to sustainability is reflected
            in our strategic efforts to develop a
            comprehensive supply chain framework
            that is both resilient and responsible. This
            framework ensures that we have clear
            policies, procedures and performance
            metrics in place to mitigate risks, ensure
            compliance and drive sustainability.
            We have implemented several policies
            that serve as guiding principles for our
            operations, ensuring alignment with our
            values and objectives across our supplier
            framework, including farmers, thirdparty manufacturers, service providers,
            transporters, suppliers of agricultural and
            non-agricultural materials, capital goods,
            franchisees, dealers and distributors.
            This includes the Supplier Code of
            Conduct (SCoC) which outlines aspects
            such as Human Rights, Labour Standards
            and Workplace Standards; Anti-Bribery
            and Anti-Corruption; Data Protection,
            Information Security, Intellectual Property
            Rights, child labour, forced labour, health
            and safety, freedom of association
            and right to collective bargaining,
            prevention of discrimination, disciplinary
            practices, working hours, remuneration
            and management systems. This code
            stipulates that every supplier should
            operate their business ethically and with
            the utmost integrity. All our suppliers are
            required to mandatorily adhere to this
            code and it is an integral component of
            their contracts. Suppliers who repeatedly
            fail to comply with any facets of the TCP
            SCoC may face contract termination.Our sustainable supply chain framework
            is reinforced by a suite of policies,
            including the Sustainable Supply Chain
            Policy and the Green Procurement Policy.
            These policies necessitate that our
            suppliers align with TCP’s commitment
            to sustainability, such as reducing the
            consumption of natural resources,
            optimising the use of plastics, obtaining
            external certifications like ISO 14001
            and 50001, and fostering environmental
            consciousness among their suppliers too.
            Adherence to the Tata Code of Conduct
            is mandatory for all our suppliers,
            ensuring that our shared values of
            ethical conduct and integrity are upheld
            across the supply chain. One of the key
            objectives of the Business and Human
            Rights Working Group is to provide
            training that supports awareness and
            understanding of those risks through
            the business. This includes developing,
            monitoring and reviewing of risk
            assessments and audits related to our
            suppliers. Furthermore, we actively
            encourage our suppliers to seek and
            utilise opportunities related to ESG
            factors, as well as to proactively address
            and manage potential risks within their
            own operations.
            Annually, we engage with our suppliers
            on these key policies/standards,
            including, the Anti-Bribery Policy,
            Business and Human Rights Policy,
            Supplier Code of Conduct, Green
            Procurement Policy, Tata Code of
            Conduct and the Memorandum of
            Understanding or Agreement, to obtain
            their acknowledgment and consent.
