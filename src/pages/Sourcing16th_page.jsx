    Our supply chain optimisation efforts in the context of food procurement encompass a range of strategies
    designed to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and improve overall performance:

      <li className='mb-2'>By opening a packing centre for pulses
at Indore, we have been able to source
a range of pulses from Indore/ Madhya
Pradesh region and pack near the source
itself. Earlier, this quantum was being
moved to packing centres in Maharashtra,
Karnataka and Haryana. Indore, being
in the central part of India, also offers
logistical advantages. Thus, we have been
able to optimise the Delivered cost, with
product travelling lesser than what it was
doing earlier</li>
      <li className='mb-2'>Shakti Solar Salt is one of the mass market salts that we
deal with. For West, this primarily comes from the region
of Gandhidham – a coastal town along the Gulf of Kutch
in Gujarat. With other inland solar salt sources available
in places like Rajasthan, we identified and developed
sources in this region. With this, we were able to cater to
the demand of far-off places in UP, Haryana, Punjab – by
optimising the effective distance travelled and sourcing
from region closer to demand. This also provided us with an
opportunity to develop new markets for the products which
were not previously getting served, making this proposition
a sustainable one for long term business</li>
