        <div className='mb-2'>Embracing our sustainability journey, we conducted a
comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for tea,
the single biggest contributor to our revenue stream.
This study adheres to the ISO 14040/44 standards and
encompasses the entire journey of tea leaves from cradle
to grave. The assessment meticulously considers every
stage, including the supply of raw materials, transportation
to our facilities, the manufacturing process, consumption of
electricity and fuel and the packaging of the final product,
as well as its use and end-of-life disposal.
The insights gleaned from the LCA have provided valuable
guidance on the environmental footprint of our products,
with a particular focus on Scope 3 emissions. As a
Company with a substantial share of Scope 3 emissions,
the LCA has enabled us to conduct a materiality analysis
specific to these categories, enhancing our understanding
of their impact on our business. This analysis has also
been independently verified by a third party, reinforcing
the credibility of our findings and aiding us in refining our
strategies for decarbonisation.</div>
