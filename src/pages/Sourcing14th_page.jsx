Our efforts to preserve natural resources and promote biodiversity play a key role in encouraging sustainable
agricultural practices. This delivers higher yields to the growers/ farmers and better-quality raw materials to us.
Through our partnerships with organisations like Trustea and Rainforest Alliance, we promote soil health, ensure that
our growers minimise the use of chemicals in their agricultural practices and respect the interplay between people
and the natural environment in their surroundings.
