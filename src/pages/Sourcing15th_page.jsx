            Our objective is to secure full
transparency for every product we
offer, extending all the way to the
last mile of the supply chain. This
aims to give us more control and
enhanced visibility over our operations.
As a result, we are in a better
position to substantially improve our
environmental footprint and enhance our social impact. Moreover, this
approach also helps us maintain a
robust, uninterrupted supply chain.
At Organic India, we prioritise
sustainability across our operations,
ensuring full traceability of each
kilogram of material right down to
the farmer level. Our meticulous
record-keeping goes all the way up to
manually maintained farmer diaries to
monitor our supply chain. All farmers
working with Organic India are
systematically registered as vendors
in our SAP system, streamlining
our supply chain management.Furthermore, we uphold the integrity
of our organic offerings through
stringent adherence to valid organic
certifications.
End-to-end traceability in the
agricultural commodity industry
involves tracking the journey of a
product from its raw form on the
farm to the packaged item sold to
consumers. This includes every stage
of its lifecycle such as harvesting,
processing, packaging, transporting,
and ultimately, sale.
