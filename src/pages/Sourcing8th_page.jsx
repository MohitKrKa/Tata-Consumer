      Given the challenges of food safety,
we engaged with the Tea Research
Association (TRA), an accredited
body in the tea industry, to conduct
sessions in Assam, Jorhat, Kolkata,

  North Bank, Terai and Duar. These
sessions focused on food safety
awareness, corrective measures and
best practices. To address the difficulty
in tracking individual Small Tea
Growers (STGs), we began involving
multiple producer associations across
various regions and provided group
food safety compliance trainings. In
certain regions, we partnered with
our industry peers, to conduct joint
training sessions. These collaborative
efforts allowed us to pool resources
and expertise for maximum impact.
Additionally, we organised sensitisation
sessions specifically designed for food
safety officials, ensuring they are wellinformed about the latest standards
and best practices.

    The initiative reached over 3,000
participants through intensive
training sessions and continues to
expand its outreach, representing
a significant step forward in
responsible agricultural practices
within India’s tea industry.
Encouraged by the grower’s interest
and increasing participation, Tata
Consumer Products Limited plans to
expand the project to other regions
in India. This effort underscores the
company’s commitment to FSSAI
compliance, consumer health and
environmental sustainability
