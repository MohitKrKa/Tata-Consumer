            Supplier desk assessments are
conducted with a systematic approach
to verifying evidence, ensuring
compliance and uphold due diligence.
On-site evaluations, referred to as
second-party assessments, are carried
out by either our internal teams or
external consultants to gain firsthand
insight into supplier operations. We
also facilitate Good Manufacturing
Practice (GMP) audits to ensure our
vendors adhere to quality standards
and regulatory requirements, providing
support through procedural guidance,
compliance training and corrective
action planning. Both desk and on-site
supplier assessments follow standards
and methodologies from established
industry or multi-stakeholder initiatives,
including ISO and BRC, ensure
consistency and uphold high-quality
benchmarks.
