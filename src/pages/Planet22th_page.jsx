Our Conscious Reengineering initiative is at the forefront of sustainable packaging solutions, strategically redesigning
packaging to reduce plastic usage and prevent new plastics from entering the environment. Complementing this, the
Designed for Recyclability approach ensures packaging is created with efficient recycling in mind, easing the burden on
waste management systems and supporting the circular economy. This focus on recyclability not only bolsters product
sustainability but also promotes responsible consumption and waste practices among consumers.
