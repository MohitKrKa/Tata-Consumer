            Supplier desk assessments are
            conducted with a systematic approach
            to verifying evidence, ensuring
            compliance and upholding due
            diligence. On-site evaluations, referred
            to as second-party assessments, are
            carried out by either our internal teams
            or external consultants to gain firsthand
            insight into supplier operations. We
            also facilitate Good Manufacturing
            Practice (GMP) audits to ensure our
            vendors adhere to quality standards
            and regulatory requirements, providing
            support through procedural guidance,
            compliance training and corrective
            action planning. Both desk and on-site
            supplier assessments follow standards
            and methodologies from established
            industry or multi-stakeholder initiatives,
            including ISO and BRC, too ensure
            consistency and  uphold high-quality
            benchmarks.
