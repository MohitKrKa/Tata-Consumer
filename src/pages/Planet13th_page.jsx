            <div className='mb-2'>At TCP, we recognise that
biodiversity conservation is critical
to both ecological balance and the
sustainability of our agricultural value
chain. We are committed to minimising
our environmental footprint while
ensuring responsible stewardship of
natural resources through sustainable
sourcing, regenerative practices and
ecosystem conservation.
The Taskforce on Nature-related
Financial Disclosures (TNFD) provides
a structured framework for businesses

to assess and manage nature-
related risks—critical for the food

and beverage sector, as it relies on
biodiversity and ecosystem services
like soil health, water availability, and
pollination, which directly impact crop

yields, sourcing stability and long-
term business viability. As part of our

commitment to nature-related risk
management, we have conducted
a TNFD-aligned assessment to
better understand location-specific
sensitivities, operational dependencies
on ecosystem services and our
contributions to nature-related
changes. The assessment covers our
operations including plantation and tea estates, manufacturing units,
storage and packaging facilities as
well as office and administrative
buildings. To refine our biodiversity
strategy, we have initiated the LEAP
(Locate, Evaluate, Assess and Prepare)
approach, enabling us to map risks,
dependencies and intervention areas.</div>

<div className='mb-2'>Our nature-related assessment followed
the TNFD’s recommended LEAP
approach, beginning with a location
screening exercise to identify priority
locations, followed by a corporate-level
assessment of dependencies, impacts,risks and opportunities. For impacts and
dependencies, we employed ENCORE
(Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities,
Risks and Exposure) to evaluate how
our four business verticals—plantation
estates, manufacturing centers, storage/
packaging centers and offices—interact
with ecosystem services. To assess
nature-related risks, we utilized the
WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter, which
evaluates physical and transition risks
across our operations. Our opportunities
stem from addressing identified risks
and leveraging our dependencies
to drive positive environmental and
operational outcomes.
