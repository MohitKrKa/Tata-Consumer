          Empowering Growers: Comprehensive Training for Tea Safety

          The initiative aims to enhance tea safety and sustainability by
          educating Small Tea Growers (STGs) on key areas such as safe pesticide
          use, pre-harvest intervals, pest control, chemical traceability, soil
          treatment and awareness of banned chemicals.

            Given the challenges of food safety, we engaged with the Tea
            Research Association (TRA), an accredited body in the tea industry,
            to conduct sessions in Assam, Jorhat, Kolkata, North Bank,

          <div className="md:w-1/3">
            Terai and Duar over the past month. These sessions focused on food
            safety awareness, corrective measures and best practices. To address
            the difficulty in tracking individual Small Tea Growers (STGs), we
            began involving multiple producer associations across various
            regions and provided group food safety compliance training. In
            certain regions, we partnered with our industry peers, to conduct
            joint training sessions. These collaborative efforts allowed us to
            pool resources and expertise for maximum impact. Additionally, we
            organised sensitisation sessions specifically designed for food
            safety officials, ensuring they are well-informed about the latest
            standards and best practices.

          <div className="text-xl text-blue-500">Outcome</div>
            The initiative reached over 3,000 participants through intensive
            training sessions and continues to expand its outreach, representing
            a significant step forward in responsible agricultural practices
            within India's tea industry. Encouraged by the grower's interest and
            increasing participation, Tata Consumer Products Limited plans to
            expand the project to other regions in India. This effort
            underscores the company's commitment to FSSAI compliance, consumer
            health and environmental sustainability.
