<span className='text-[#1368b4] text-2xl'> 991 </span>in 2014-15 to just
<span className='text-[#1368b4] text-2xl'> 185 </span> by October 2024, with no
human fatalities. The innovative use
of tentacle fencing and mock drills has
further mitigated risks. Additionally,

CIRCULAR ECONOMY
</div>
<div className='mb-3'>
Our circularity strategy is designed to
promote sustainability through a threepart framework: Compliance, Smart
Packaging and Peer Interaction. The
Compliance component emphasises
our commitment to adhering to
environmental regulations and
standards. We follow the Extended
Producer Responsibility (EPR) mandate
and are committed to the Plastic Pact,
ensuring that our practices align with
environmental standards and contribute
to a circular economy. Next, we focus
on smart packaging, which involves
conscious reengineering to avoid plastic
introduction and designs that prioritise
recyclability, facilitating efficient
recycling processes. This approach not
only reduces waste but also enhances
the sustainability of our products.
Beyond internal efforts, we actively
collaborate with industry peers to
accelerate plastic reduction, and pioneer
sustainable packaging solutions that
redefine industry best practices.
Our objective is to design packaging
solutions that are not only effective
and fit-for-purpose but also composed
of materials that can be recycled or
repurposed after their initial use. By
2026, 70% of our packaging materials
will be recyclable, compostable or
reusable across all geographies, with
a target to achieve 100% by 2030.
Through conscious reengineering, we
have successfully reduced the weight
of a 1kg salt pouch by 11%, optimising
material usage and minimising plastic
use in our packaging.

EXTENDED PRODUCER
RESPONSIBILITY (EPR)
</div>
<div className='mb-3'>
In India, we have been fully compliant
with the extended producer
responsibility (EPR) requirements since
2018. By partnering with designated
waste producer responsible
organisations (PROs) in several
states and union territories, we are
able to recover the equivalent of
100% of the packaging used for our
Beverages, Foods and RTD divisions.
Our commitment to EPR ensures that
we take responsibility for the entire
lifecycle of our products, including their
post-consumer phase.
Our R&D division leads in eco-friendly
packaging solutions and innovation,
focusing on reducing material use,
refining existing processes, enhancing
consumer recycling practices and
shifting to sustainable alternatives,
thus demonstrating a profound
commitment to environmental
sustainability and responsible product
lifecycle management.

            PLASTICS PACT 
            </div>
<div className='mb-3'>
As a pioneering member of the
India Plastics Pact and an engaged
participant in the UK and EU Plastics
Pacts, we are dedicated to the
responsible stewardship of packaging
materials. TCP has a significant role
in shaping the future of packaging,
with our representatives playing an
influential part in advisory committees
and Collaborative Action Groups
(CAGs). They are instrumental in
crafting strategies that address the
sustainable management of packaging
amidst the complexities of cost control,
market dynamics, consumer safety
and waste management.

<div className='text-xl font-semibold text-[#06aeef] mb-2'>
SMART PACKAGING 
</div>
<div className='mb-3'>
In our circularity framework, we prioritise
conscious reengineering to avoid the
introduction of plastic in our packaging
materials. This effort not only reduces
our reliance on non-renewable resources
but also minimises plastic waste.
Additionally, we focus on designing
our packaging for recyclability, which
ensures that materials can be efficiently
recovered and reused.
Our business has made significant
strides in sustainability by
implementing plastic reduction
measures across various verticals.
We have successfully downsized and
downgauged laminates, leading to an
annual reduction by 125 MT of plastic
in our foods and coffee segments.
Additionally, we have successfully
discontinued the use of Biaxially
Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP)
overwraps on Stock Keeping Units
(SKUs) that are shipped to Australia
from our facility in Cochin. For Tata salt
products, this year we have boosted
the use of recyclable laminates to 94%,
up from 86% in previous year, thereby increasing recyclable laminate content
used in business to 230 MT annually.
Overall, TCP now utilises 72%
recyclable packaging, a substantial
increase from the previous year’s 62%.
In the reporting year, we have started
the use of recycled plastic in our
packaging for Himalayan bottles and
tea packaging to a certain extent.
Annually, approximately 100 MT of
recycled plastic was utilised in our
production processes.

STRATEGIC COLLABORATIONS
</div>
<div className='mb-3'>
We are leveraging peer collaboration
to drive plastic reduction, investing in
R&D for innovative materials, including
biodegradable and more recyclable
composites, and participating in
shared recycling facilities for greater
efficiency. Joint ventures are explored
to develop new plastic reduction
technologies and sustainable business
models like reusable packaging
systems. Knowledge exchange platforms enable us to share insights
and learn from industry challenges and
successes in reducing plastic use and
improving waste management.
We collaborate with suppliers and
distributors to minimise plastic use
and implement take-back schemes.
Consumer engagement is vital, with
TCP and other brands educating the
public on recycling and responsible
consumption.
