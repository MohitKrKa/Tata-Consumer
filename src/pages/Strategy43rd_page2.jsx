        BUILDING AN ADAPTIVE ORGANISATION
      </div>
      <div className='mb-2'>
        Given the uncertainties, challenges and changes in the macro-economic environment, the leadership at Tata Consumer
        Products (TCP) recognises the need to undertake a regular review of the wider organisation and align the same to the
        strategic pillars. Equally, given the intent of organic and inorganic growth, we recognise that the true measure of success
        in integrating different businesses extends beyond operational alignment and market expansion. It hinges on the ability to
        integrate people, fostering a unified and inclusive culture. Over the past year, TCP has expanded; integrating new businesses
        and multiple operating locations, worldwide. This includes welcoming Capital Foods, Organic India, and Tata Coffee, adding
        to its earlier acquisitions of Tata Soulfull, NourishCo, and Tata SmartFoodz. The heart of this transformation lies in how TCP
        navigates the complexities of blending multi-legacy and multi-generational organisations, creating a cohesive, inclusive, and
        future-ready environment.

          <div className='mb-2'>We have reimagined our organisation
            and invested in requisite capacity
            as well as in infusing capabilities
            ahead of the curve. This is aimed at
            enabling the organisation to grow
            at pace, whilst transforming into a
            sector-leading multi-category FMCG
            organisation. This also enables our
            ambition on innovation through
            streamlining processes and upskilling
            talent across the value chain. Across
            India and international markets, we
            have conducted regular organisational
            reviews and implemented new
            operating models, such as the
            6-cluster structure for India Sales, the
            Direct Sales model for the USA, and
            the category-based Quality Assurance
            and Regulatory Affairs (QARA)

            model, Tata Consumer Products adopts a
            strategy of weaving a strong cultural fabric
            for the organisation and incorporating
            diversity of heritage and identity. Shared
            values and a common vision help shape a
            unified sense of belongingness, without losing
            one’s core identity. The result is a celebration
            of diversity, fostering a sense of shared
            ownership and pride among employees. </div>

            As we scale our organisation, and
