                As we advance towards our ambition
                of becoming a global premier FMCG
                organisation, strengthening our
                capabilities is essential to sustaining
                our competitive advantage.
                Leadership development remains a
                core priority, as we continue to groom
                individuals who can drive strategic
                growth. We consistently enhance
                skills across the organisation,
                equipping talent to meet evolving
                industry demands.
                Digital and functional expertise
                represent a critical part of this
                journey, embedding technology and
                specialised knowledge into every
                aspect of our operations.

                To strengthen our leadership pipeline,

                    <p className='mb-2 '>
                        As we continue to accelerate our pace
                        towards becoming a premier global
                        FMCG company it has become critical
                        for Leaders to role model what growth
                        and transformation look like, both at
                        an enterprise level and at a personal
                        level. These have been enshrined in
                        the TCP Growth Mindset Behaviours
                        (GMB), which are intricately
                        interwoven with the five values of the
                        organisation. As a result, the GMBs,
                        which have Tata Consumer Products’
                        values at its core, were instituted
                        as a means to differentiate who we
                        are, as an organisation, and how our
                        stakeholders will experience us. The
                        current efforts ensure we embed them
                        across the organisation for unified
                        action towards achieving our goals.
                        The Growth Mindset Behaviours
                        are also envisaged as the driving
                        force behind creating an enabling,
                        collaborative, and winning culture,
                        essential for long-term value creation.
                        To embed this Growth Mindset
                        globally, we engaged colleagues
                        through a series of culture books,
                        videos, conversations with the
                        leadership, along with special sessions
                        to help internalise the behaviours,
