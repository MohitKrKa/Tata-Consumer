As we advance towards our ambition
of becoming a global premier FMCG
organisation, strengthening our
capabilities is essential to sustaining
our competitive advantage.
Leadership development remains a
core priority, as we continue to groom
individuals who can drive strategic
growth. We consistently enhance
skills across the organisation,
equipping talent to meet evolving
industry demands.
Digital and functional expertise
represent a critical part of this
journey, embedding technology and
specialised knowledge into every
aspect of our operations.

LEADERSHIP
DEVELOPMENT

<div className='mb-2'>
To strengthen our leadership pipeline,
we have developed a comprehensive
leadership development strategy
with specially curated in-house
programmes in partnership with
TMTC (Tata Management Training
Centre) and other global institutions.
The various programmes help
strengthen leadership capabilities
and equip identified high-potential
employees with essential skills
through structured learning, case
studies and leadership challenges.

          We recognise that strong frontline
management is essential for sustained
growth and operational excellence.
Alongside leadership development, we
are investing in structured professional
development initiatives to strengthen
managerial capabilities at the frontline.
Aarohan is designed to equip frontline

AS THE FIRST STEP OF
LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT </div>
<div className='mb-2'>
In collaboration with Saville
and Holdsworth Limited (SHL),
a talent acquisition and talent
management solutions firm, we
have introduced the 360° Feedback
Survey and Occupational Personality
Questionnaire (OPQ) for senior
leaders. These assessments provide
a structured evaluation of leadership
effectiveness, offering insights into
behavioural traits and growth areas.
By integrating feedback from multiple
stakeholders, we enable leaders to
refine their approach and align their
development with organisational
objectives.

        <div className='mb-2'>
        Building functional expertise is
essential for sustained performance
in a dynamic business environment.
Through the ‘Skill Up!’ programme,
we have introduced targeted learning
interventions across Sales, Operations,
Finance, Marketing and Digital. Across
functions, we are driving a futurefocused learning agenda building
proficiency in digital skills in addition
to function specific capabilities. These
initiatives equip our workforce with
cutting-edge capabilities, ensuring
they remain prepared for evolving
industry demands.

    MINDSET BEHAVIOURS</div>
    <div className='mb-2'>
    As we continue to accelerate our pace
towards becoming a premier global
FMCG company it has become critical
for Leaders to role model what growth
and transformation look like, both at
an enterprise level and at a personal
level. These have been enshrined in
the TCP Growth Mindset Behaviours
(GMB), which are intricately
interwoven with the five values of the
organisation. As a result, the GMBs,
which have Tata Consumer Products’
values at its core, were instituted
as a means to differentiate who we
are, as an organisation, and how our
stakeholders will experience us. The
current efforts ensure we embed them
across the organisation for unified
action towards achieving our goals.
The Growth Mindset Behaviours
are also envisaged as the driving
force behind creating an enabling,
collaborative, and winning culture,
essential for long-term value creation.
To embed this Growth Mindset
globally, we engaged colleagues
through a series of culture books,
videos, conversations with the
leadership, along with special sessions
to help internalise the behaviours,
