                <div className='text-[#58595b] mb-2'>We are committed to addressing the impacts
of climate change on our operations and
communities. By incorporating climate-related
considerations into our strategic planning, we
aim to ensure long-term sustainability and
resilience.
We have embraced the guidelines set forth by
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD) and established a robust
climate risk assessment framework. The
primary aim of this framework is to empower
us to identify and mitigate both physical and
transitional risks associated with climate
change across our operations and the value
chain. In line with TCFD recommendations,
we have identified major risks within the
physical and transitional categories. These
risks have been thoroughly evaluated—both
qualitatively and quantitatively—and have
been strategically mapped to correspond
with each of our business units. To ensure the
validity of these risks, we have engaged in
meaningful conversations with stakeholders,
including business and department heads,
employing a 4-factor Likert scale for precise
assessment.
Our commitment to sustainability is further
reflected in the integration of comprehensive
mitigation strategies and backup plans into
TCP’s long-term vision and the Enterprise
Risk Management (ERM) framework. This
integration ensures that our response to
climate risks is not only strategic but also
ingrained in the very fabric</div>
