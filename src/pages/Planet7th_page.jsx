              Amid Munnar’s lush landscapes, our ITO facility has adopted
              circular economy principles to cut environmental impact and boost
              energy efficiency.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Faced with the dual challenge of managing industrial waste and
              curbing energy consumption, ITO Munnar has ingeniously converted
              this challenge into an opportunity. By implementing a
              waste-to-energy system, the facility set out with a clear
              objective: to repurpose process waste, reducing disposing waste in
              landfills and tapping into the latent energy potential of what was
              once deemed unusable.
            </p>
            <p>
              The strategy was straightforward yet impactful. Every bit of
              process waste was prevented from ending up in landfills. It was
              meticulously collected to serve as biofuel for the facility’s
              boiler. This initiative not only found a sustainable use for the
              waste but also led to an impressive annual energy saving. On a
              daily basis, around 30 tons of waste with a moisture content of
              50-60% is injected into the boiler, supplemented by other biofuels
              like wood chips, pallets and briquettes. However, the process
              waste, accounts for 60% of the boiler’s fuel mix. The lessons
              learned from ITO Munnar’s experience are clear: circular economy
              practices are not only feasible in an industrial context but also
              immensely beneficial, turning waste into a valuable asset that
              yields ecological and economic gains.

            We are committed to addressing the impacts of climate change on our
            operations and communities. By incorporating climate-related
            considerations into our strategic planning, we aim to ensure
            long-term sustainability and resilience. We have embraced the
            guidelines set forth by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
            Disclosures (TCFD) and established a robust climate risk assessment
            framework. The primary aim of this framework is to empower us to
            identify and mitigate both physical and transitional risks
            associated with climate change across our operations and the value
            chain. In line with TCFD recommendations, we have identified major
            risks within the physical and transitional categories. These risks
            have been thoroughly evaluated—both qualitatively and
            quantitatively—and have been strategically mapped to correspond with
            each of our business units. To ensure the validity of these risks,
            we have engaged in meaningful conversations with stakeholders,
            including business and department heads, employing a 4-factor Likert
            scale for precise assessment. Our commitment to sustainability is
            further reflected in the integration of comprehensive mitigation
            strategies and backup plans into TCP’s long-term vision and the
            Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. This integration ensures
            that our response to climate risks is not only strategic but also
            ingrained in the very fabric
