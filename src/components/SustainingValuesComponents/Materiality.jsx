                        At TCP, we believe that growing together—with our stakeholders, communities and the planet—lays the foundation for a better tomorrow. Our materiality assessment plays a crucial role in this journey, helping us evaluate the environmental and social impact
                        of our operations while identifying opportunities for sustainable growth. In FY 2021-22, we conducted a comprehensive materiality study aligned with major national and international frameworks, including the Sustainability Accounting Standards

                        By analysing industry trends, conducting a market assessment and engaging with stakeholders through surveys and discussions,
                        we were able to identify pertinent material issues that could impact our
                        business strategy and operations. Stakeholder insights, risk evaluations and opportunity analyses have
                        been instrumental in prioritising these issues, ensuring that they
                        are seamlessly integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. This holistic approach strengthens our future roadmap by aligning these issues with our business goals, sustainability strategies and the UN SDGs, all of which are depicted below in a materiality matrix.

                        The CSR & Sustainability Committee of the Board and TCP’s senior management have played an active role in the arriving at the materiality assessment outcomes. The Board is regularly appraised of the performance of the company on such material issues. Furthermore, to stay attuned to the changing business dynamics and maintaining relevance to stakeholder perspectives, the company plans to undertake detailed materiality assessments once every three years.

                            We consider risk management
                            crucial for planning our strategies
                            and achieving our long-term goals. Understanding that our success hinges on adeptly navigating risks and seizing opportunities, we have integrated an extensive risk management framework encompassing all organisational aspects. The material issues that could impact our business, the rationale
                            for their selection and our strategies for managing these risks, including financial implications, have been captured in detail in our BRSR.

                            Every year, we conduct a risk assessment at the Tata Consumer Group level, supervised and executed by a Board- level Risk Management Committee. This Committee oversees and implements risk mitigation strategies.

                            Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework also accounts
                            for sustainability concerns. Key risks related to consumer trends, sustainability and workforce are rigorously evaluated by Group management within our ERM. Specifically, we have also assessed the climate-related risks and opportunities in line with the TCFD recommendations and undertaken water vulnerability assessments to understand the implications for our operations and supply chain.

Our strategies and progress in addressing these material concerns are documented in this section.
